**Abstract** - Computer systems that run for long periods of time can suffer from a phenomenon known as software aging. Just like people, software can age. This phenomenon, however, can be viewed as a problem in computer systems because it can accelerate the depletion of resources and even lead to system failures. Databases are widely used software nowadays and can be affected by such a phenomenon, since they need to run for long periods of time uninterruptedly. Therefore, studies that investigate the possible effects of software aging in database environments are very necessary. In this work, we experimentally investigate the software aging phenomena in a database environment using PostgreSQL as the DBMS (Database Management System). By performing statistical analysis on the measurement data, we detected a suspicious phenomenon of software aging induced by workloads in memory and CPU usage. Additionally, our process analysis identified suspicious processes that can lead to memory degradations.
